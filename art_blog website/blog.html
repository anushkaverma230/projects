<h2><mark style="background-color: pink; font-family:courier">*Astronomical Night</mark></h2>

<p>is the period between astronomical dusk and astronomical dawn when the Sun is
   between 18 and 90 degrees below the horizon and does not illuminate
    the sky. As seen from latitudes between about 48.56° and 65.73°
     north or south of the Equator, complete darkness does not occur around the
     summer solstice because, although the Sun sets, it is never more than 18° below
     the horizon at lower culmination, −90° Sun angles occur at the
     Tropic of Cancer on the December solstice and Tropic of Capricorn on the June
      solstice, and at the equator on equinoxes.</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night">
       <p>As per the wikipedia The opposite of night is day (or "daytime", to distinguish it from "day"
         referring to a 24-hour period). Twilight is the period of night after sunset or before sunrise
         when the Sun still illuminates the sky when it is below the horizon. At any given time, one side of Earth
         is bathed in sunlight (the daytime), while the other side is in darkness caused by Earth blocking
         the sunlight. The central part of the shadow is called the umbra, where the night is darkest.</p>
         <p>-from wikipedia</p>

      <pre style="font-size:165%;"><b>EFFECT ON LIFE</b></pre>

    <h2><i>1.</i>Biological</h2>
      <p>The disappearance of sunlight, the primary energy source for life
        on Earth, has dramatic effects on the morphology, physiology and
         behavior of almost every organism. Some animals sleep during
          the night, while other nocturnal animals, including moths and <del>batball</del>
        <ins>crickets</ins>, are active during this time. The effects of day and
        night are not seen in the animal kingdom alone – plants have also
          evolved adaptations to cope best with the lack of sunlight
         during this time. For example, crassulacean acid metabolism is a unique type of
          carbon fixation which allows some photosynthetic plants to store
         carbon dioxide in their tissues as organic acids during the night, which can then be used during the day to synthesize carbohydrates.
          This allows them to keep their stomata closed during the daytime,
          preventing transpiration of water when it is precious.</p>

   <strong style="text-align:center; color:lightgreen">Duration and geography</strong>


 <pre style="background-color: lightgrey; color:black">
      On Earth, an average night lasts shorter than daytime due to two factors.Firstly, the Sun's apparent disk is not a point, but has an
       angular diameter of about 32 arcminutes (32'). Secondly, the atmosphere refracts sunlight so that some of itreaches the ground
        when the Sun is below the horizon by about 34'.The combination of these two factors means that light reaches the ground when
         the center of the solar disk is below the horizon by about 50'.
</pre>

     <h2> <i>2.</i>Social</h2>
       <p>The first constant electric light was demonstrated in 1835.
          As artificial lighting has improved, especially after the
          Industrial <sup> Revolution</sup>, night time activity has increased and
           become a significant part of the economy in most places. Many
           establishments, such as nightclubs, bars, convenience stores,
            fast-food restaurants, gas stations, distribution facilities,
            and police stations now operate 24 hours a day or stay open as
            late as 1 or 2 a.m. Even without artificial light, moonlight sometimes
             makes it possible to travel or work <sub>outdoors</sub> at night.</p>

    <h2><i>3.</i>Cultural and psychological aspects</h2>
        <p>Night is often associated with danger and evil, because of the psychological
           connection of night's all-encompassing darkness to the fear of the unknown and darkness's hindrance
            of a major sensory system (the sense of sight). Nighttime is naturally associated with vulnerability
            and danger for human physical survival. Criminals, animals, and other potential dangers can be
             concealed by darkness. Midnight has a particular importance in human imagination and culture.</p>

      <pre>The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.<br> Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at <br> Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.</pre>

<p style="text-align:left;font-family:">The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry Night. "Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory</p>

<h2>details</h2>
<p>Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of the day and under various weather conditions, such as the sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;
eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.
Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Night in paintings (Western art)</h2>
<p>The depiction of night in paintings is common in Western art. Paintings that feature a night scene as the theme may be religious or history paintings, genre scenes, portraits, landscapes, or other subject types. Some artworks involve religious or fantasy topics using the quality of dim night light to create mysterious atmospheres. The source of illumination in a night scene—whether it is the moon or an artificial light source—may be depicted directly, or it may be implied by the character and coloration of the light that reflects from the subjects depicted.</p>

<h3 id="h3"></a> <mark style="background-color:#EADCD0">Symbolism( for art)</mark></h3>

<p>Black and grey shades often symbolize gloom, fear, mystery, superstitions, evil, death, secret, sorrow. The light source in most religious paintings symbolize hope, guidance or divinity.
In fantasy paintings light could symbolize magic, like the following lines of a poem entitled The Magic:
"There's magic in this night, enshrouded in this night, hidden, like a lamp in an old man's robe, there's MAGIC</p>

<p>The depiction of night in paintings is common in art in Asia. Paintings that feature the night scene as the theme are mostly portraits and landscapes.
Some artworks which involve religious or fantasy topics use the quality of dim night light to create mysterious atmospheres. They tend to illustrate the
illuminating effect of the light reflection on the subjects under either moonlight or
artificial light sources.</p>
